# Flavor Library

The Flavor library is responsible for retrieving the hardware/software measurements of the host in a pre-defined format. 
When integrated with the Host Verification service, Flavor would be equivalent to what is known today as the Whitelist.

## Key features
- Create flavors for VM and container images
- Create Platform Flavors for Intel and VMWare Hosts
- Create Software Flavors from Manifest XMLs
- Create Generic Flavors from Asset Tag Certificates
