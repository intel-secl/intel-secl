##### Upgrade to v4.0.0:
*TA and WLA* :
In v4.0.0, TA has modified policies on TPM and NVRAM and it requires to re-provision itself with HVS. This would need following 
ENV variable for the upgrade. Also, WLA would need to recreate keys as Binding Key gets updated after re-provisioning.

```shell
BEARER_TOKEN
```

NOTE:
If in case some components needs to get upgraded from v3.5.0, directly to the latest version then it would require ENV variables 
if they are mentioned above and comes in the upgrade path.
e.g if iHUB needs upgrade from v3.5.0 to v4.0.0 then it would require following ENV variables,

```shell
HVS_BASE_URL
SHVS_BASE_URL
```
